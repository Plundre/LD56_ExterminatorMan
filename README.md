This is our submission for LD56, October 2024, theme: Tiny Creatures

# You are the Exterminator Man!
### Pick up the flamethrower, and get rid of those PESKY tiny creatures!
### How long can you survive until they overrun you? :bug:
### Fight against the endless tides of bugs

First ever project using Godot! :grin: 

Music, sounds, and art is made by the team for this project

We would've liked to add more enemies varieties, destroyable eggs/spawners, and more complex levels.

But, alas, this is how far we got :grinning: 

The project was made using Godot, C#, Piskelapp.com, sfxr.me, and more


Plundre: Software, game design, art | Groennisse: Music + sound
