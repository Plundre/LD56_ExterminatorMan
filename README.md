## A submission for Ludum Dare 56
# You are the Exterminator Man!
### Pick up the flamethrower, and get rid of those PESKY tiny creatures!
### How long can you survive until they overrun you? :bug:
### Fight against the endless tides of bugs

Fairly happy with it as a first ever project using Godot! :grin: 

We would've liked to add more enemies varieties, destroyable eggs/spawners, and more complex levels.

But, alas, this is how far we got :grinning: 



The project was made in Godot, using C#

Music, sounds, and art is also made by the team for this project

Plundre: Software + art | Groennisse: Music + sound
